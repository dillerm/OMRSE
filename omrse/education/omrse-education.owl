        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An interesting question about whether there must be another participant who is the &quot;educator&quot;.  Some might object that many people are &quot;self taught&quot;.  A real case of being self taught is the first person who learned to play a stringed instrument, or to spin a ball on the top of a finger.  There was no previous information about that.  The ICEs acquired are via one&apos;s sensory systems (vision, proprioception, auditory, etc.).

On the other hand, in the case of those who are self-taught by reading books or watching videos, or acquiring some other form of ICEs concretized outside their brain, one argument might be that the author of those ICEs somehow &quot;plays a role&quot; in the education, although they cannot participate in the education process itself (If I read Aristotle, and through repeated application of the information I acquire through doing so, develop the ability to write better ontology definitions, surely Aristotle did not actively participate in my particular education process, although he did influence it in a very real way).</rdfs:comment>
