# Files from the February 2021 ODK migration

These are all the files of OMRSE as they were during the Feburary 2021 ODK migration. 

- omrse-edit-external.ofn are all those axioms in OMRSE deemed "external", i.e. officially part of another ontology. For reference.
- release-diff-merged.txt Contains a ROBOT diff with all removed and added assertions of the final release (omrse.owl) before and after the migration to ODK.
- release-diff-merged.md. The same as above, in markdown. May be easier to read.
- release-diff-build.txt Contains the Logical axioms introduced and removed by the ODK redundancy stripping mechanism. This is due to the way the [full release artefact](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/ReleaseArtefacts.md#release-artefact-2-full-required) is defined.
